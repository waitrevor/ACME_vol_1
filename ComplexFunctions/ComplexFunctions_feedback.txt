Problem 1 (5 points):
Score += 5

Problem 2 (5 points):
Need to describe the quantity and multiplicity of the zeros on all these plots
Score += 3

Problem 3 (5 points):
Plots look great, but describe the poles (how many and their multiplicity) for each plot
Score += 2

Problem 4 (10 points):
Add descriptions of zeros and poles. Your third graph is incorrect; check your denominator/paranthesis. The second plot needs to be zoomed out to capture all the information
Score += 4

Problem 5 (10 points):
Need to describe what your plots mean as far as zeros and poles
Score += 5

Problem 6 (10 points):
Also plot these zoomed in to gain insight into the poles/zeros. You will find something interesting in each case. Make sure to describe in writing what that is
Score += 3

Code Quality (5 points):
Score += 5

Total score: 27/50 = 54.0%


Comments:
	Looks great! The descriptions are the most important part of this lab. Let me know if you have questions about interpretting the plots
